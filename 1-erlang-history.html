- founded by Lars Magnus Ericsson

- since 1876

- Bell Labs could not compete in Scandinavia

- Ericsson was almost monopoly telecom company in region during XX century

- It's 1984 now!

- AXE telephone exchange (since 1974)

- PLEX (cross between Fortran and a macro assembler)

- Berkeley introduced UNIX 4.2 BSD

- UNIX can run on different architecures including VAX (CISC)

  **Motivation is "to make something like PLEX, to run on ordinary hardware, only better"**

- Handling a very large number of concurrent activities

- Systems distributed over several computers

- Interaction with hardware

- Very large software systems

- Continuous operation over several years

- Software maintenance (reconfiguration, etc.) without stopping the system

- Stringent quality and reliability requirements

- Fault tolerance both to hardware failures and software errors

.right-column[

- Erlang = Ada, EriPascal, Chill, PLEX, Euclid + ML, Smalltalk, Prolog

- Erlang was meta-interpreter in Prolog by **Joe Armstrong** (1985)

- Erlang with own VM created by **Mike Williams** in C is 70 times faster (1990)

- In 1995 AXE-N project (telephone exchange in C++) collapsed, reorganised and re-started in Erlang as **AXD** ATM

.right-column[

- In 1998 were announced GPRS system prototype and AXD301, 10-160 Gbps ATM switch

- Source code contains 1.5M lines of Erlang (main complex control logic) and 0.5M lines of C/C++ (device drivers)

- Designed from scratch in less than 3 years

- One of the customers was British Telecom (the largest voice ATM station in the world)

- During trial period (first 5 years) only 1 minor issue occurred.

- 99.9999999% reliability (downtime is 31 ms per year)

.left-column[
## Erlang VM
### - Concurrency vs parallelism
]

.right-column[

- True parallelism: **Java, C++, Fortran**

 - real UNIX threads are heavy

 - requires very high developer skill

 - overhead for processes sync and management (MPI, OpenMP etc)

 - race conditions, deadlocks,

- Concurrency: **JavaScript, Lua, Python, Ruby, etc...**

 - actually, only one UNIX thread for all

 - ... but concurrent apps still can have problems with deadlocks / race conditions

 - because of only one real thread, one fat concurrent task will affect all application

```javascript
(() => {for (i = 0; i <= 1000000; i++) {console.log(i)}})()
```
